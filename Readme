This repo contains the code and code book for the Getting and Cleaning programming project from JHU's Coursera Data Science Specialization.

The script in run_analysis will 1.  Create a directory to store the downloaded information; 2. Download and unzip the data; 3. load the data 
into R and transform it into a tidy data set with requested data as assigned.  Finally, the tidy data set is written as a text file to 
the computer.  This will satisfy the parameters of the project.

Scripting details and justifications can be found in Codebook.md in this repository.
