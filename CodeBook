There are 89 lines of code.

Lines 1-10 are text that describe what the program will do:

## The following program will:
##  1.Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
##  2.Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
##  3.Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
##  4.Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names. 
##  5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set 
##    with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Lines 11-20 create the directory to house the downloaded data, and then downloads the data.

Lines 25-48 download the raw text files into R objects and then combines the objects into a single data set.  This completes
Step 1.

At this point, the data set has no column lables.

Line 52 reads the names of the feature vector variables into an object called feature_names.  When the feature vector is read initially,
there are two columns of variables, V1 and V2. V2 contains the names that we want, so that is why we subset on the second column after 
reading in the text file.

Line 57 captures the mean and standard deviation measurement index locations in feature_names. Using grep, the code looks for the
upper and/or lower case strings of 'mean' and 'std' to find the desired meaurements.  The index locations are stored in a vector
called MeanstdIndex.

We now need to subset the full data set into the measurements we want, along with Participant ID and Activity.  Line 59 does
just that by taking the full data set, taking all of the rows, and then taking columns 1, 2, and the features index locations plus 2.
The reason we must use the index locations plus two is that they are shifted two places to the right in the data set.  The index
vector captured the values within the length of feature, but the dataset has two additional columns--Participant and Activity;
Hence the plus 2.

Line 61 renames the columns in the desired, smaller dataset.  This complete step 2 above.

The Activity column is coded in values 1 thru 6 and we wish these to be descriptive of the actual activity.  Line 67 reads in the 
activity names from the text file.  Line 69 transforms the Activity column to a factor variable with levels being in column 1 and
labels being in column 2 of activity_names.  The Activity column now has the descriptive names as desired. This completes Step 3.

Lines 70-80 clean up some of the names in the feature vectors using gsub and some regular expressions.

Lines 80-89 bring in the dplyr library which aids in grouping the data.  The data are grouped by participant and Activity and the mean 
function is applied to all of the featured variables via the grouping.  Finally, the new tidy data set is written to a file called
"tidyset.txt".

This completes the project.
